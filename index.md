I'm a physicist exploring the intersection of active matter, biophysics, and intelligent materials. Currently, I'm pursuing my PhD at the University of Amsterdam, where my research focuses on building intelligent active matter systems. This work combines theoretical physics with experimental approaches to understand how we can create materials whose constituents can sense, remember, and respond to their environment.

## Research Interests

My current work investigates how we can push the boundaries of active matter beyond simple stochastic particles. I'm particularly interested in:

- Developing intelligent materials platforms that incorporate sensors, memory, and control systems
- Understanding the collective behavior of robotic active matter
- Exploring the connections between active matter physics and biological systems
- Studying plant biophysics and rheology, including the biomechanics of plant structures and movement

## Academic Background

- **PhD in Physics** (Nov. 2023-present)  
  University of Amsterdam  
  Research: Intelligent Active Matter and Biophysics

- **MSc in Physics** (2021-2023)  
  University of British Columbia  
  Research: [Information dynamics in the yielding transition of amorphous solids](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0436957)

- **BA in Physics & BA in Mathematics** (2016-2019)  
  University of Colorado Boulder  
  Double major in Physics and Mathematics

## Recent Work

I recently completed a paper on the biomechanics of glandular trichome rupture ([arXiv 2412.14507](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14507)), which was presented at NWO Biophysics and JMC 2024 in Marseille. New Scientist even [published an article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2463134-tomato-plants-are-covered-in-tiny-anti-pest-booby-traps/) and [made a YouTube video about the paper!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h88eIaWfpM)

My current PhD project involves scaling up robotic active matter systems to hundreds of robots, while incorporating memory and environmental sensing capabilities. This work aims to bridge the gap between traditional active matter studies and intelligent materials that can process information about their environment.
