### Problem 2: Heat Produced During a Cliff Diver's Fall
#### Question
The cliff divers of Acapulco take pride and pleasure in hurling themselves from a height of 35m into a channel of water which is only 4-6m deep (depending on the swell of the sea). A diver launches himself with a speed of 1 m/s from the top of the cliff. He has a mass of 70kg. His speed is 25m/s just as he enters the water. How much thermal energy is produced during the fall (before the impact with the water)? Where does the thermal energy end up (i.e. which objects experience a [small] change in temperature)?
